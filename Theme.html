			<h1> THEME 04 : Basic UX Purpose </h1>

			<p>
				This module was the fourth and the last module of the 1st semester of the MMD programme. In this module we were able to get the basic understanding of and experience with how interaction between users and user interfaces works, as well as which theories , tools and methods we can use for research , design , testing and production of digital solution for smartphones so that our work was based on the specific insights about the actual users instead of our won gut feeling and untenable assumption. The main point of this was to collaborate with a case company that want to improve their users’ needs and usage situations into the design in balance with the company’s strategy, needs and goals for the design solution.
